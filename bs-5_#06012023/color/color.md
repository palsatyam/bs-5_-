```Color
Bootstrap is supported by an extensive color system that themes our styles and components. This enables more comprehensive customization and extension for any project.

```Theme colors
We use a subset of all colors to create a smaller color palette for generating color schemes, also available as Sass variables and a Sass map in Bootstrapâ€™s scss/_variables.scss file.

$theme-colors: (
  "primary":    $primary,     (blue)
  "secondary":  $secondary,   (gray)
  "success":    $success,     (green)
  "info":       $info,        (red)
  "warning":    $warning,     (yellow)
  "danger":     $danger,      (sky-blue)
  "light":      $light,       (white)
  "dark":       $dark         (black)
);
