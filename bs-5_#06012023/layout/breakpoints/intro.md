```Breakpoints
Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.


```Core concepts
Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design. Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.

Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint. Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. We most commonly use min-width in our media queries.

Mobile first, responsive design is the goal. Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.


```Available breakpoints
Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as grid tiers, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.
